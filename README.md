<p>A simple linear regression in machine learning is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a single feature (x) to predict a continuous target variable (y) using a linear function.</p>
<p>A linear function is a function that can be written in the form:

$$y = ax + b$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants, and $x$ is the input variable. A linear function has a constant rate of change, meaning that the difference between any two output values is proportional to the difference between the corresponding input values. A linear function can be represented by a straight line on a graph, where the slope of the line (Coefficient) is equal to $a$, and the y-intercept is equal to $b$. A linear function can be used to model situations that have a constant rate of change, such as speed, distance, or cost.</p>
